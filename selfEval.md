# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Getting my variable defined was a struggle. I didn't capitalize "Object" the first time around and I got the error "Object not defined". This made me look at my object rather than made me check to see if I'd capitalized the word. I had to leave off yesterday and come back to it this morning to figure it out and finally got it working because I'd been looking at the wrong section of code.  
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
It's going pretty well. I have made a cheat sheet with with some of the vocab and syntax we have learned. I find that if I take really detailed notes, I never look at them again so I am trying to take really quick, breif notes with just the most important things that I think I will not remember.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I'm finding that a lot of people are having the same problem that I am and they've already been solved.
